## Features

> **Notes about the command format:**
>
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.\
    >   e.g., in `add --title TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add --title Murder at Yishun`.
>
> * Parameters with command line flags can be in any order.\
    >   e.g., if the command specifies `--title TITLE --date DATE`, `--date DATE --title TITLE` is also acceptable.
>
> * Parameters that are not preceded by command line flags must appear in the order specified.\
    >   e.g., if the command specifies `close INDEX` INDEX must come after close.
>
> * Optional parameters are enclosed in square brackets.\
    >   e.g., `--title TITLE [--victim VICTIM]` means the victim parameter is optional.
> * The double-dash `--` is a reserved prefix used to identify flags, so it cannot be used as part of an input value.
