## Setting up, Getting Started

## Design

### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](images/ArchitectureDiagramOverall.png)

The Architecture Diagram given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

#### Overall logic

![Overall Sequence Diagram](images/SequenceDiagramGenericCombined.png)

The main code flow is as follows:

1. Print welcome message
2. Initialize CaseManager with saved info from `data.txt` if it exists
3. Read user input from System.in
4. Parse user input to obtain a Command object that contains the
   information necessary to execute the command
5. execute user command
6. until the command is to exit the program, repeat steps 3 to 5
7. Save the updated list of commands to `data.txt`
8. Print exit message

### UI Component

{Add a high-level description of the UI component here}

The API of this component is primarily specified in `{add relevant classes here}`.

#### Structure of the UI Component

The UI consists of three main parts: `Display`, `Parser`, and `Validator`. All these work together to handle user
interaction through a console-based command-line interface.

The UI component uses standard input/output streams. The interaction flow is managed in the `SGSafe` main class.

#### Responsibilities

The UI component:

- **Displays formatted output** to the user using `Display`, which wraps messages in visual dividers
- **Parses user commands** using `Parser` to convert raw input into `Command` objects
- **Validates input** using `Validator` to ensure data integrity before execution
- **Keeps a reference to the Command component**, as it relies on Commands to execute user actions
- **Depends on classes in the Domain component**, as it displays `Case` objects from `CaseManager`

#### Key Classes

**Display**: Handles all user-facing output with formatted messages, including welcome/goodbye messages and command
results.

**Parser**: Interprets raw input and creates structured `Command` objects by extracting keywords, validating flags, and
enforcing input constraints.

**Validator**: Provides utility methods to validate flags, check required fields, and verify case ID format (6-character
hexadecimal).

#### Interaction Flow

1. `SGSafe.mainLoop()` reads user input from console
2. `Parser.parseInput()` validates input and creates the appropriate `Command` object
3. `Command.execute()` is called to perform the action
4. Commands interact with `CaseManager` to modify or retrieve `Case` objects
5. Results are displayed via `Display.printMessage()`
6. Exceptions are caught and error messages shown through `Display`

### CaseFile Component

{Add a high-level description of the CaseFile component here}
The API of this component is primarily specified in `{add relevant classes here}`.

#### Structure of the CaseFile Component

---

### Command Component

The command component is responsible for handling user commands. It interprets user input, executes the corresponding
actions on the CaseFile component, and returns results to the UI component.
The API of this component is primarily specified in `Command`.
When a user inputs a command, the UI component uses the `Parser` to create an instance of the appropriate `Command`
subclass.

#### Structure and Responsibility of the Command Component

Each different command is represented by a subclass of the abstract `Command` class, encapsulating the logic for that
specific command.

The responsibilities of the command component include:

- Each command class implements the `execute()` method, which contains the logic to perform the command's action.
  Additional methods may be included as needed to support the command's functionality.
- In addition, each command class may have its own attributes to store parameters needed for execution.
- The command component interacts with the CaseFile component to manipulate case data as required by the command, and it
  uses the UI component to display results or error messages to the user.

#### Key Classes

- **Command**: An abstract class that defines the structure for all command classes. It includes an abstract `execute()`
  method that must be implemented by all subclasses.
- **ENUM: SettingType**: An enumeration that defines different settings types that can be modified by the setting
  commands.
- **ENUM: CaseListingMode**: An enumeration that defines different modes for listing cases, such as by date or by
  status.

#### Class Diagram

The following diagram illustrates the structure of the command component and some of the noteworthy methods in the
commands.

## Appendix A: Product scope

### Target user profile

- police officer who needs to manage a significant number of cases
- prefers desktop apps over other types of apps
- can type fast
- prefers typing to using the mouse
- comfortable using CLI apps

### Value proposition

- manage and track cases faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

## Appendix B: User Stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have) - `* *`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`

| Priorities | Version | As a ...           | I want to ...       | So that I can ...                                    |
|------------|---------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| ***        | v1.0    | front-desk officer | create case         | record cases into the system                         |
| ***        | v1.0    | front-desk officer | edit case details   | edit cases that are typed wrongly                    |
| ***        | v1.0    | front-desk officer | mark case as closed | close cases that have been attended to               |
| ***        | v1.0    | front-desk officer | delete case         | delete duplicates                                    |

## Appendix C: Non-Functional Requirements

- Should work on any mainstream OS as long as it has Java 17 or above installed.
- Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
- A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be
  able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
  {More to be added}
