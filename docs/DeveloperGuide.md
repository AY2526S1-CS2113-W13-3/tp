## Setting up, Getting Started

## Design & implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

## Appendix A: Product scope

### Target user profile

- police officer who needs to manage a significant number of cases
- prefers desktop apps over other types of apps
- can type fast
- prefers typing to using the mouse
- comfortable using CLI apps

### Value proposition

- manage and track cases faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app
